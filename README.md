# API fetcher for steam user data
This code includes one main script where you add your personal API-key from steam and the desiered Steam-ID you want to get data about. 
The other two scripts script are the parts that actually fetch the data (api.py) and save the data to a database (save_data.py).
To get the code working you need to change api_key = 'API_KEY' and steam_id = 'STEAM_ID' to your personal api key and the Steam-ID you want data about.
